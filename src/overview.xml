    <title>The Subject of This Textbook</title>
  <p>
    Before starting with the content of the text, we first ask the basic question: what <em>is</em> linear algebra?
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>Linear:</em> having to do with lines, planes, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Algebra:</em> solving equations involving unknowns.
      </li>
    </ul>
    The name of the textbook highlights an important theme: the synthesis between algebra and geometry.  It will be very important to us to understand systems of linear equations both <em>algebraically</em> (writing equations for their solutions) and <em>geometrically</em> (drawing pictures and visualizing).
  </p>

  <remark>
    <p>
      The term <q>algebra</q> was coined by the <m>9</m>th century mathematician Abu Ja<rsq/>far Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi.  It comes from the Arabic word <em>al-jebr</em>, meaning reunion of broken parts.
    </p>

  <p>
    At the simplest level, solving a system of linear equations is not very hard.  You probably learned in high school how to solve a system like
    <me>
      \syseq{
      x + 3y - z = 4;
      2x - y + 3z = 17;
      \. \+ y - 4z = -3\rlap.
      }
    </me>
    However, in real life one usually has to be more clever.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Engineers need to solve many, many equations in many, many variables.  Here is a tiny example:
        <me>
          \syseq{
    3x_1 + 4x_2 + 10x_3 + 19x_4 - 2x_5 - 3x_6 = 141;
    7x_1 + 2x_2 - 13x_3 - 7x_4 + 21x_5 + 8x_6 = 2567;
    -x_1 + 9x_2 + \frac 32x_3 + x_4 + 14x_5 + 27x_6 = 26;
    \frac 12x_1 + 4x_2 + 10x_3 + 11x_4 + 2x_5 + x_6 = -15\rlap.
  }
        </me>
      </li>
      <li>
        Often it is enough to know some information about the set of solutions, without having to solve the equations in the first place.  For instance, does there exist a solution?  What does the solution set look like geometrically?  Is there still a solution if we change the <m>26</m> to a <m>27</m>?
      </li>
      <li>
        Sometimes the coefficients also contain parameters, like the <em>eigenvalue equation</em>
        <me>
        \syseq{
        (7-\lambda)x + y + 3z = 0 ;
        -3x + (2-\lambda)y - 3z = 0 ;
        -3x - 2y + (-1-\lambda)z = 0\rlap.
        }
        </me>
      </li>
      <li>
        In data modeling, a system of equations generally does not actually have a solution.  In that case, what is the best approximate solution?
      </li>
    </ul>

  <title>How to Use This Textbook</title>

  <p>
    There are a number of different categories of ideas that are contained in most sections.  They are listed at the top of the section, under <em>Objectives</em>, for easy review.  We classify them as follows.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>Recipes:</em> these are algorithms that are generally straightforward (if sometimes tedious), and are usually done by computer in real life.  They are nonetheless important to learn and to practice.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Vocabulary words:</em> forming a conceptual understanding of the subject of linear algebra means being able to communicate much more precisely than in ordinary speech.  The vocabulary words have precise definitions, which must be learned and used correctly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Essential vocabulary words:</em> these vocabulary words are essential in that they form the essence of the subject of linear algebra.  For instance, if you do not know the definition of an eigenvector, then by definition you cannot claim to understand linear algebra.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Theorems:</em> these describe in a precise way how the objects of interest relate to each other.  Knowing which recipe to use in a given situation generally means recognizing which vocabulary words to use to describe the situation, and understanding which theorems apply to that problem.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Pictures:</em> visualizing the geometry underlying the algebra means interpreting and drawing pictures of the objects involved.  The pictures are meant to be a core part of the material in the text: they are not just a pretty add-on.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    This textbook is exclusively targeted at Math 1553 at Georgia Tech.  As such, it contains exactly the material that is taught in that class; no more, and no less: <em>students in Math 1553 are responsible for understanding all visible content.</em>  In the online version some extra material (most examples and proofs, for instance) is hidden, in that one needs to click on a link to reveal it, like this:
  </p>

  <remark hide-type="true">
    <title>Hidden Content</title>
    <p>
      Hidden content is meant to enrich your understanding of the topic, but is not an official part of Math 1553.  That said, the text will be very hard to follow without understanding the examples, and studying the proofs is an excellent way to learn the conceptual part of the material.  (Not applicable to the PDF version.)

    Finally, we remark that there are over 140 interactive demos contained in the text, which were created to illustrate the geometry of the topic.
