  <p>
    In this section, we interpret a basis of a subspace <m>V</m> as a <em>coordinate system</em> on <m>V</m>, and we learn how to write a vector in <m>V</m> in that coordinate system.

    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>\cB = \{v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_m\}</m> is a basis for a subspace <m>V</m>, then any vector <m>x</m> in <m>V</m> can be written as a linear combination
        <me>x = c_1v_1 + c_2v_2 + \cdots + c_mv_m</me>
        in exactly one way.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Recall that to say <m>\cB</m> is a <em>basis</em> for <m>V</m> means that <m>\cB</m> spans <m>V</m> and <m>\cB</m> is linearly independent.  Since <m>\cB</m> spans <m>V</m>, we can write any <m>x</m> in <m>V</m> as a linear combination of <m>v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_m</m>.  For uniqueness, suppose that we had two such expressions:
        <md>
          <mrow>x &amp;= c_1v_1 + c_2v_2 + \cdots + c_mv_m</mrow>
          <mrow>x &amp;= c_1'v_1 + c_2'v_2 + \cdots + c_m'v_m.</mrow>
        </md>
        Subtracting the first equation from the second yields
        <me>0 = x-x = (c_1-c_1')v_1 + (c_2-c_2')v_2 + \cdots + (c_m-c_m')v_m.</me>
        Since <m>\cB</m> is linearly independent, the only solution to the above equation is the trivial solution: all the coefficients must be zero.  It follows that <m>c_i-c_i'</m> for all <m>i</m>, which proves that <m>c_1=c_1',\,c_2=c_2',\ldots,\,c_m=c_m'</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
  </fact>

  <specialcase>
    <p>
      Consider the standard basis of <m>\R^3</m> from this <xref ref="dimension-eg-Rn"/>:
      <me>e_1=\vec{1 0 0},\quad e_2=\vec{0 1 0}, \quad e_3=\vec{0 0 1}.</me>
      According to the above <xref ref="dimension-unique-coeff"/>, every vector in <m>\R^3</m> can be written as a linear combination of <m>e_1,e_2,e_3</m>, with unique coefficients.  For example,
      <me>v = \vec{\color{seq1}3 \color{seq2}5 \color{seq3}{-2}}
      = \textcolor{seq1}{3}\vec{1 0 0} + \textcolor{seq2}{5}\vec{0 1 0}
      \textcolor{seq3}{{}- 2}\vec{0 0 1}
      = \textcolor{seq1}{3}e_1 + \textcolor{seq2}{5}e_2
      \textcolor{seq3}{{}- 2}e_3.</me>
      In this case, <em>the coordinates of <m>v</m> are exactly the coefficients of <m>e_1,e_2,e_3</m>.</em>
    </p>
  </specialcase>

  <p>
    What exactly are coordinates, anyway?  One way to think of coordinates is that they give directions for how to get to a certain point from the origin.  In the above example, the linear combination <m>3e_1+5e_2-2e_3</m> can be thought of as the following list of instructions: start at the origin, travel <m>3</m> units north, then travel <m>5</m> units east, then <m>2</m> units down.
  </p>

    <idx><h><m>\cB</m>-coordinates</h><h>definition of</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\cB=\{v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_m\}</m> be a basis of a subspace <m>V</m>, and let
        <me>x = c_1v_1 + c_2v_2 + \cdots + c_mv_m</me>
        be a vector in <m>V</m>.  The coefficients <m>c_1,c_2,\ldots,c_m</m> are the <term>coordinates of <m>x</m> with respect to <m>\cB</m></term>.  The <term><m>\cB</m>-coordinate vector of <m>x</m></term> is the vector
        <me>[x]_\cB = \vec{c_1 c_2 \vdots, c_m} \quad\text{in }\R^m.</me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    <idx><h><m>\cB</m>-coordinates</h><h>informally</h></idx>
    If we change the basis, then we can still give instructions for how to get to the point <m>(3,5,-2)</m>, but the instructions will be different. Say for example we take the basis
    <me>v_1=e_1+e_2 = \vec{1,1,0}, \quad v_2=e_2 = \vec{0 1 0},\quad v_3 =e_3 = \vec{0 0 1}.</me>
    We can write <m>(3,5,-2)</m> in this basis as <m>3v_1+2v_2-2v_3</m>. In other words: start at the origin, travel northeast <m>3</m> times as far as <m>v_1</m>, then <m>2</m> units east, then <m>2</m> units down.
    In this situation, we can say that <q><m>3</m> is the <m>v_1</m>-coordinate of <m>(3,5,-2)</m>, <m>2</m> is the <m>v_2</m>-coordinate of <m>(3,5,-2)</m>, and <m>-2</m> is the <m>v_3</m>-coordinate of <m>(3,5,-2)</m>.</q>

    <idx><h><m>\cB</m>-coordinates</h><h>labeling points</h></idx>
    <p>
      The above <xref ref="dimension-defn-Bcoords"/> gives a way of using <m>\R^m</m> to <em>label</em> the points of a subspace of dimension <m>m</m>: a point is simply labeled by its <m>\cB</m>-coordinate vector.  For instance, if we choose a basis for a plane, we can label the points of that plane with the points of <m>\R^2</m>.

    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            By the <xref ref="basis-theorem"/>, any two linearly independent vectors form a basis for <m>\R^2</m>.  Clearly <m>v_1,v_2</m> are not multiples of each other, so they are linearly independent.
          </li>
          <li>
            To say <m>[w]_\cB={1\choose 2}</m> means that <m>1</m> is the <m>v_1</m>-coordinate of <m>w</m>, and that <m>2</m> is the <m>v_2</m>-coordinate:
            <me>w = v_1 + 2v_2 = \vec{1 1} + 2\vec{1 -1} = \vec{3 -1}.</me>
          </li>
          <li>
            We have to solve the vector equation <m>v=c_1v_1 + c_2v_2</m> in the unknowns <m>c_1,c_2</m>.  We form an augmented matrix and row reduce:
            <me>\amat{1 1 5; 1 -1 3}
            \quad\xrightarrow{\text{RREF}}\quad
            \amat{1 0 4; 0 1 1}.</me>
            We have <m>c_1=4</m> and <m>c_2=1</m>, so <m>v = 4v_1+v_2</m> and
            <m>[v]_\cB = {4\choose1}.</m>
          </li>
        </ol>
        In the following picture, we indicate the coordinate system defined by <m>\cB</m> by drawing lines parallel to the <q><m>v_1</m>-axis</q> and <q><m>v_2</m>-axis</q>.  Using this grid it is easy to see that the <m>\cB</m>-coordinates of <m>v</m> are <m>{5\choose 1}</m>, and that the <m>\cB</m>-coordinates of <m>w</m> are <m>{1\choose 2}</m>.

Residents of Palo Alto refer to northwest as <q>north</q> and to northeast as <q>east</q>.  There is a reason for this: the old road to San Francisco is called El Camino Real, and that road runs from the southeast to the northwest in Palo Alto.  So when a Palo Alto resident says <q>go south two blocks and east one block</q>, they are giving directions from the origin to the Whole Foods at <m>w</m>.

      Let <m>\cB = \{v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_m\}</m> be a basis of a subspace <m>V</m>.
      Finding the <m>\cB</m>-coordinates of a vector <m>x</m> means solving the vector equation
      <me>x = c_1v_1 + c_2v_2 + \cdots + c_mv_m.</me>
      If <m>x</m> is <em>not</em> in <m>V</m>, then this equation has no solution, as <m>x</m> is not in <m>V = \Span\{v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_m\}</m>.  In other words, the above equation is <em>inconsistent</em> when <m>x</m> is not in <m>V</m>.
