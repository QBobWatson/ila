  <introduction>
    <p>
      Diagonal matrices are the easiest kind of matrices to understand: they just scale the coordinate directions by their diagonal entries.
        In <xref ref="similarity"/>, we saw that similar matrices behave in the same way, with respect to different coordinate systems.  Therefore, if a matrix is similar to a diagonal matrix, it is also relatively easy to understand.  This section is devoted to the question: <q>When is a matrix similar to a diagonal matrix?</q>
    </p>
  </introduction>

  <subsection>
    <title>Diagonalizability</title>
      <p>
        Before answering the above question, first we give it a name.

      <statement>
        <p>
          An <m>n\times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> is <term>diagonalizable</term> if it is similar to a diagonal matrix: that is, if there exists an invertible <m>n\times n</m> matrix <m>C</m> and a diagonal matrix <m>D</m> such that
          <me>A = CDC\inv.</me>

        Any diagonal matrix is <m>D</m> is diagonalizable because it is
          <xref ref="similarity-eq-reln" text="title">similar to itself</xref>.
          For instance,
        <me>
          \mat{1 0 0; 0 2 0; 0 0 3} = I_3\mat{1 0 0; 0 2 0; 0 0 3}I_3\inv.
        </me>
      </p>
    </specialcase>

    <example>
      <p>
          Most of the examples in <xref ref="similarity"/> involve diagonalizable matrices:
        <me>
        \def\idb{\quad\parbox{\widthof{because it equals}}{is diagonalizable\\because it equals}\quad}
        \begin{split}

          \mat{1 1; 1 -1} \mat{2 0; 0 -1} \mat{1 1; 1 -1}\inv\\
          \frac 15\mat{-8 -9; 6 13} \amp\idb
          \frac 12\mat{-1 -3; 2 1} \mat{2 0; 0 -1} \left(\frac 12\mat{-1 -3; 2 1}\right)\inv\\
          \mat{-1 0 0; -1 0 2; -1 1 1} \amp\idb
          \mat{-1 1 0; 1 1 1; -1 0 1} \mat{-1 0 0; 0 -1 0; 0 0 2} \mat{-1 1 0; 1 1 1; -1 0 1}\inv.

    <specialcase xml:id="diag-of-similar">
      <idx><h>Diagonalizability</h><h>similar matrices</h></idx>
      <p>
        If a matrix <m>A</m> is diagonalizable, and if <m>B</m> is similar to <m>A</m>, then <m>B</m> is diagonalizable
          as well by this <xref ref="similarity-eq-reln"/>.

      <title>Powers of diagonalizable matrices</title>
    <p>
      Multiplying diagonal matrices together just multiplies their diagonal entries:
      <me>
        \mat{x_1 0 0; 0 x_2 0; 0 0 x_3}\mat{y_1 0 0; 0 y_2 0; 0 0 y_3}
        = \mat{x_1y_1 0 0; 0 x_2y_2 0; 0 0 x_3y_3}.
      </me>
      Therefore, it is easy to take powers of a diagonal matrix:
      <me>
        \mat{x 0 0; 0 y 0; 0 0 z}^n = \mat{x^n 0 0; 0 y^n 0; 0 0 z^n}.
      </me>
      By this <xref ref="similarity-powers"/>, if <m>A = CDC\inv</m> then <m>A^n = CD^nC\inv</m>, so it is also easy to take powers of <em>diagonalizable</em> matrices.
This will be very important in applications to difference equations in <xref ref="stochastic-matrices"/>.

      A fundamental question about a matrix is whether or not it is diagonalizable.  The following is the primary criterion for diagonalizability.  It shows that diagonalizability is an eigenvalue problem.
    </p>

    <theorem type-name="Diagonalization Theorem" xml:id="diagonalization-thm">
      <idx><h>Diagonalizability</h><h>criterion</h></idx>
      <idx><h>Eigenvector</h><h>and diagonalizability</h></idx>
      <statement>
        <p>
          An <m>n\times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> is diagonalizable if and only if <m>A</m> has <m>n</m> linearly independent eigenvectors.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this case, <m>A = CDC\inv</m> for
          <me>
            C = \mat{| |,, |; v_1 v_2 \cdots, v_n; | |,, |}
            \qquad
            D = \mat{\lambda_1 0 \cdots, 0; 0 \lambda_2 \cdots, 0;
              \vdots, \vdots, \ddots, \vdots; 0 0 \cdots, \lambda_n},
          </me>
          where <m>v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n</m> are linearly independent eigenvectors, and <m>\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots,\lambda_n</m> are the corresponding eigenvalues, in the same order.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          First suppose that <m>A</m> has <m>n</m> linearly independent eigenvectors <m>v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n</m>, with eigenvalues <m>\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots,\lambda_n</m>.  Define <m>C</m> as above, so <m>C</m> is invertible by the <xref ref="imt-2"/>.  Let <m>D = C\inv A C</m>, so <m>A = CDC\inv</m>.  <xref ref="linear-trans-pick-columns" text="title">Multiplying by standard coordinate vectors</xref> picks out the columns of <m>C</m>: we have <m>Ce_i = v_i</m>, so <m>e_i = C\inv v_i</m>.  We multiply by the standard coordinate vectors to find the columns of <m>D</m>:
          <me>
            De_i = C\inv A Ce_i = C\inv Av_i = C\inv\lambda_i v_i = \lambda_iC\inv v_i = \lambda_ie_i.
          </me>
          Therefore, the columns of <m>D</m> are multiples of the standard coordinate vectors:
          <me>
            D = \mat{\lambda_1 0 \cdots, 0 0; 0 \lambda_2 \cdots, 0 0;
            \vdots, \vdots, \ddots, \vdots, \vdots;
            0 0 \cdots, \lambda_{n-1} 0; 0 0 \cdots, 0 \lambda_n}.
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now suppose that <m>A = CDC\inv</m>, where <m>C</m> has columns <m>v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n</m>, and <m>D</m> is diagonal with diagonal entries <m>\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots,\lambda_n</m>.  Since <m>C</m> is invertible, its columns are linearly independent.  We have to show that <m>v_i</m> is an eigenvector of <m>A</m> with eigenvalue <m>\lambda_i</m>.  We know that the standard coordinate vector <m>e_i</m> is an eigenvector of <m>D</m> with eigenvalue <m>\lambda_i</m>, so:
          <me>
            Av_i = CDC\inv v_i = CDe_i = C\lambda_ie_i = \lambda_iCe_i = \lambda_i v_i.
          </me>
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>

    <p>
      By this <xref ref="evecs-linindep"/>, if an <m>n\times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> has <m>n</m> <em>distinct</em> eigenvalues <m>\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots,\lambda_n</m>, then a choice of corresponding eigenvectors <m>v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n</m> is automatically linearly independent.

        An <m>n\times n</m> matrix with <m>n</m> distinct eigenvalues is diagonalizable.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Apply the <xref ref="diagonalization-thm"/> to the matrix
          <me>A = \mat{1 0 0; 0 2 0; 0 0 3}.</me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          This diagonal matrix is in particular upper-triangular, so its eigenvalues are the diagonal entries <m>1,2,3</m>.  The standard coordinate vectors are eigenvalues of a diagonal matrix:
          <me>
            \mat{1 0 0; 0 2 0; 0 0 3}\vec{1 0 0} = 1\cdot\vec{1 0 0} \qquad
            \mat{1 0 0; 0 2 0; 0 0 3}\vec{0 1 0} = 2\cdot\vec{0 1 0}
          </me>
          <me>
            \mat{1 0 0; 0 2 0; 0 0 3}\vec{0 0 1} = 3\cdot\vec{0 0 1}.
          </me>
          Therefore, the diagonalization theorem says that <m>A=CDC\inv</m>, where the columns of <m>C</m> are the standard coordinate vectors, and the <m>D</m> is the diagonal matrix with entries <m>1,2,3</m>:
          <me>
            \mat{1 0 0; 0 2 0; 0 0 3} =
            \mat{1 0 0; 0 1 0; 0 0 1} \mat{1 0 0; 0 2 0; 0 0 3}
            \mat{1 0 0; 0 1 0; 0 0 1}\inv.
          </me>
          This just tells us that <m>A</m> is similar to itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Actually, the diagonalization theorem is not completely trivial even for diagonal matrices.  If we put our eigenvalues in the order <m>3,2,1</m>, then the corresponding eigenvectors are <m>e_3,e_2,e_1</m>, so we also have that <m>A = C'D'(C')\inv</m>, where <m>C'</m> is the matrix with columns <m>e_3,e_2,e_1</m>, and <m>D'</m> is the diagonal matrix with entries <m>3,2,1</m>:
          <me>
            \mat{1 0 0; 0 2 0; 0 0 3} =
            \mat{0 0 1; 0 1 0; 1 0 0} \mat{3 0 0; 0 2 0; 0 0 1}
            \mat{0 0 1; 0 1 0; 1 0 0}\inv.
          </me>
          In particular, the matrices
          <me>
            \mat{1 0 0; 0 2 0; 0 0 3}
            \sptxt{and}
            \mat{3 0 0; 0 2 0; 0 0 1}
          </me>
          are similar to each other.

      <p>
        We saw in the above example that changing the order of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors produces a different diagonalization of the same matrix. There are generally many different ways to diagonalize a matrix, corresponding to different orderings of the eigenvalues of that matrix.  The important thing is that the eigenvalues and eigenvectors have to be listed in the same order.

        There are other ways of finding different diagonalizations of the same matrix.  For instance, you can scale one of the eigenvectors by a constant <m>c</m>:
        <me>
          \begin{split}
          A \amp= \mat{| | |; v_1 v_2 v_3; | | |}
          \mat{\lambda_1 0 0; 0 \lambda_2 0; 0 0 \lambda_3}
          \mat{| | |; v_1 v_2 v_3; | | |}\inv \\
          \amp= \mat{| | |; cv_1 v_2 v_3; | | |}
          \mat{\lambda_1 0 0; 0 \lambda_2 0; 0 0 \lambda_3}
          \mat{| | |; cv_1 v_2 v_3; | | |}\inv,
          \end{split}
        </me>
        you can find a different basis entirely for an eigenspace of dimension at least <m>2</m>, etc.

          We need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of <m>A</m>.  First we compute the characteristic polynomial:

          Therefore, the eigenvalues are <m>-1</m> and <m>2</m>.  We need to compute eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.  We start with <m>\lambda_1 = -1</m>:

          The parametric form is <m>x = -y</m>, so <m>v_1 = {-1\choose 1}</m> is an eigenvector with eigenvalue <m>\lambda_1</m>.  Now we find an eigenvector with eigenvalue <m>\lambda_2 = 2</m>:

          The parametric form is <m>x = y</m>, so <m>v_2 = {1\choose 1}</m> is an eigenvector with eigenvalue <m>2</m>.

          Therefore, the eigenvalues are <m>0</m> and <m>2</m>.  We need to compute eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.  We start with <m>\lambda_1 = 0</m>:
          <me>
(A - 0I_2)v = 0 \iff
  \mat[r]{2/3 -4/3; -2/3 4/3}v = 0
  \;\xrightarrow{\text{RREF}}\;
  \mat{1 -2; 0 0}v = 0.
          </me>
          The parametric form is <m>x = 2y</m>, so <m>v_1 = {2\choose 1}</m> is an eigenvector with eigenvalue <m>\lambda_1</m>.  Now we find an eigenvector with eigenvalue <m>\lambda_2 = 2</m>:
          <me>
            (A-2I_2)v = 0 \iff
  \mat{-4/3 -4/3; -2/3 -2/3}v = 0
  \;\xrightarrow{\text{RREF}}\;
  \mat{1 1; 0 0}v = 0.
          </me>
          The parametric form is <m>x = -y</m>, so <m>v_2 = {1\choose-1}</m> is an eigenvector with eigenvalue <m>2</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The eigenvectors <m>v_1,v_2</m> are linearly independent, so the <xref ref="diagonalization-thm"/> says that
          <me>
            A = CDC\inv \sptxt{for} C = \mat{2 1; 1 -1} \qquad D = \mat{0 0; 0 2}.
          </me>
          Alternatively, if we choose <m>2</m> as our first eigenvalue, then
          <me>
            A = C'D'(C')\inv \sptxt{for} C' = \mat{1 2; -1 1} \qquad D' = \mat{2 0; 0 0}.
          </me>

    <p>
      In the above example, the (non-invertible) matrix
      <m>A = \frac 13\smallmat{2}{-4}{-2}{4}</m>
      is similar to the diagonal matrix
      <m>D = \smallmat0002.</m>
      Since <m>A</m> is not invertible, zero is an eigenvalue by the <xref ref="imt-2" text="title">invertible matrix theorem</xref>, so one of the diagonal entries of <m>D</m> is necessarily zero.  Also see this <xref ref="diag-eg-proj"/> below.

      <solution>
        <p>
          We need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of <m>A</m>.  First we compute the characteristic polynomial by expanding cofactors along the third column:
          <me>
            \begin{split}

            \end{split}
          </me>
          Therefore, the eigenvalues are <m>1</m> and <m>2</m>.  We need to compute eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.  We start with <m>\lambda_1 = 1</m>:
          <me>
(A-I_3)v = 0 \iff
\mat{3 -3 0; 2 -2 0; 1 -1 0}v = 0
  \;\xrightarrow{\text{RREF}}\;
\mat{1 -1 0; 0 0 0; 0 0 0}v = 0.
          </me>
          The parametric vector form is

            \syseq{x = y; y = y; z = \. \+ z}

        </p>
        <p>
The eigenvectors <m>v_1,v_2,v_3</m> are linearly independent: <m>v_1,v_2</m> form a basis for the <m>1</m>-eigenspace, and <m>v_3</m> is not contained in the <m>1</m>-eigenspace because its eigenvalue is <m>2</m>.

        This is an example of an <em>orthogonal projection</em>.  We will see in <xref ref="projections"/> that <m>T</m> is a linear transformation; let <m>A</m> be the matrix for <m>T</m>.  Any vector on <m>L</m> is not moved by <m>T</m> because it is the closest point on <m>L</m> to itself: hence it is an eigenvector of <m>A</m> with eigenvalue <m>1</m>.  Let <m>L^\perp</m> be the line perpendicular to <m>L</m> and passing through the origin.  Any vector <m>x</m> on <m>L^\perp</m> is closest to the zero vector on <m>L</m>, so a (nonzero) such vector is an eigenvector of <m>A</m> with eigenvalue <m>0</m>. (See this <xref ref="evec-eg-projection"/> for a special case.)  Since <m>A</m> has two distinct eigenvalues, it is diagonalizable; in fact, we know from the <xref ref="diagonalization-thm"/> that <m>A</m> is similar to the matrix <m>\smallmat 1000</m>.

        The characteristic polynomial of <m>A</m> is <m>f(\lambda) = -(\lambda-1)^2(\lambda-2)</m>, so the eigenvalues of <m>A</m> are <m>1</m> and <m>2</m>.  We compute the <m>1</m>-eigenspace:

        As in the above <xref ref="diag-eg-shear"/>, one can check that the matrix
        <me>A_\lambda = \mat{\lambda, 1; 0 \lambda}</me>
        is not diagonalizable for any number <m>\lambda</m>.  We claim that any non-diagonalizable <m>2\times 2</m> matrix <m>B</m> with a real eigenvalue <m>\lambda</m> is similar to <m>A_\lambda</m>.  Therefore, up to similarity, these are the only such examples.
      </p>
      <p>
        To prove this, let <m>B</m> be such a matrix.  Let <m>v_1</m> be an eigenvector with eigenvalue <m>\lambda</m>, and let <m>v_2</m> be any vector in <m>\R^2</m> that is not collinear with <m>v_1</m>, so that <m>\{v_1,v_2\}</m> forms a basis for <m>\R^2</m>.  Let <m>C</m> be the matrix with columns <m>v_1,v_2</m>, and consider <m>A = C\inv BC</m>.  We have <m>Ce_1=v_1</m> and <m>Ce_2=v_2</m>, so <m>C\inv v_1=e_1</m> and <m>C\inv v_2=e_2</m>.  We can compute the first column of <m>A</m> as follows:
        <me>
          Ae_1 = C\inv BC e_1 = C\inv Bv_1 = C\inv\lambda v_1 = \lambda C\inv v_1 = \lambda e_1.
        </me>
        Therefore, <m>A</m> has the form
        <me>A = \mat{\lambda, b; 0 d}.</me>
        Since <m>A</m> is similar to <m>B</m>, it also has only one eigenvalue <m>\lambda</m>; since <m>A</m> is upper-triangular, this implies <m>d=\lambda</m>, so
        <me>A = \mat{\lambda, b; 0 \lambda}.</me>
        As <m>B</m> is not diagonalizable, we know <m>A</m> is not diagonal (<m>B</m> is similar to <m>A</m>), so <m>b\neq 0</m>.  Now we observe that

    <title>The Geometry of Diagonalizable Matrices</title>
    <idx><h>Diagonalizability</h><h>geometry of</h></idx>

    <p>
      A diagonal matrix is easy to understand geometrically, as it just scales the coordinate axes:
      <me>
        \mat{1 0 0; 0 2 0; 0 0 3}\vec{1 0 0} = 1\cdot\vec{1 0 0} \qquad
        \mat{1 0 0; 0 2 0; 0 0 3}\vec{0 1 0} = 2\cdot\vec{0 1 0}
      </me>
      <me>
        \mat{1 0 0; 0 2 0; 0 0 3}\vec{0 0 1} = 3\cdot\vec{0 0 1}.
      </me>
      Therefore, we know from <xref ref="similarity"/> that a diagonalizable matrix simply scales the <q>axes</q> with respect to a different coordinate system.  Indeed, if <m>v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n</m> are linearly independent eigenvectors of an <m>n\times n</m> matrix <m>A</m>, then <m>A</m> scales the <m>v_i</m>-direction by the eigenvalue <m>\lambda_i</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the following examples, we visualize the action of a diagonalizable matrix <m>A</m> in terms of its <em>dynamics</em>.  In other words, we start with a collection of vectors (drawn as points), and we see where they move when we multiply them by <m>A</m> repeatedly.

    <title>Algebraic and Geometric Multiplicity</title>

    <p>
      In this subsection, we give a variant of the <xref ref="diagonalization-thm"/> that provides another criterion for diagonalizability.  It is stated in the language of <em>multiplicities</em> of eigenvalues.
    </p>

    <p>
      In algebra, we define the <em>multiplicity</em> of a root <m>\lambda_0</m> of a polynomial <m>f(\lambda)</m> to be the number of factors of <m>\lambda-\lambda_0</m> that divide <m>f(\lambda).</m>  For instance, in the polynomial
      <me>f(\lambda) = -\lambda^3 + 4\lambda^2 - 5\lambda + 2 = -(\lambda-1)^2(\lambda-2),</me>
      the root <m>\lambda_0=2</m> has multiplicity <m>1</m>, and the root <m>\lambda_0=1</m> has multiplicity <m>2</m>.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> be an <m>n\times n</m> matrix, and let <m>\lambda</m> be an eigenvalue of <m>A</m>.
          <ol>
            <li>
              The <term>algebraic multiplicity</term> of <m>\lambda</m> is its multiplicity as a root of the characteristic polynomial of <m>A</m>.
            </li>
            <li>
              The <term>geometric multiplicity</term> of <m>\lambda</m> is the dimension of the <m>\lambda</m>-eigenspace.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      Since the <m>\lambda</m>-eigenspace of <m>A</m> is <m>\Nul(A-\lambda I_n)</m>, its dimension is the number of free variables in the system of equations <m>(A - \lambda I_n)x=0</m>, i.e., the number of columns without pivots in the matrix <m>A-\lambda I_n</m>.

        has only one eigenvalue <m>\lambda=1</m>.  The characteristic polynomial of <m>A</m> is <m>f(\lambda) = (\lambda-1)^2</m>, so <m>1</m> has algebraic multiplicity <m>2</m>, as it is a double root of <m>f</m>.  On the other hand, we showed in this <xref ref="diag-eg-shear"/> that the <m>1</m>-eigenspace of <m>A</m> is the <m>x</m>-axis, so the geometric multiplicity of <m>1</m> is equal to <m>1</m>.  This matrix is not diagonalizable.

Since every nonzero vector in <m>\R^2</m> is an eigenvector of <m>I_2</m> with eigenvalue <m>1</m>, the <m>1</m>-eigenspace is all of <m>\R^2</m>, so the geometric multiplicity is <m>2</m> as well.  This matrix is diagonal.

        also has characteristic polynomial <m>f(\lambda) = -(\lambda-1)^2(\lambda-2)</m>, so that <m>1</m> and <m>2</m> are the eigenvalues, with algebraic multiplicities <m>2</m> and <m>1</m>, respectively.  In this case, however, both eigenspaces are <em>lines,</em> so that both eigenvalues have geometric multiplicity <m>1</m>.  This matrix is not diagonalizable.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> be an <m>n\times n</m> matrix.  The following are equivalent:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <m>A</m> is diagonalizable.
            </li>
            <li>
              The sum of the geometric multiplicities of the eigenvalues of <m>A</m> is equal to <m>n</m>.
            </li>
            <li>
              The sum of the algebraic multiplicities of the eigenvalues of <m>A</m> is equal to <m>n</m>, and for each eigenvalue, the geometric multiplicity equals the algebraic multiplicity.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          We will show <m>1\implies 2\implies 3\implies 1</m>.  First suppose that <m>A</m> is diagonalizable.  Then <m>A</m> has <m>n</m> linearly independent eigenvectors <m>v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n</m>.  This implies that the sum of the geometric multiplicities is <em>at least</em> <m>n</m>: for instance, if <m>v_1,v_2,v_3</m> have the same eigenvalue <m>\lambda</m>, then the geometric multiplicity of <m>\lambda</m> is at least <m>3</m> (as the <m>\lambda</m>-eigenspace contains three linearly independent vectors), and so on.  But the sum of the algebraic multiplicities is greater than or equal to the sum of the geometric multiplicities by the <xref ref="diag-amgm"/>, and the sum of the algebraic multiplicities is at most <m>n</m> because the characteristic polynomial has degree <m>n</m>.  Therefore, the sum of the geometric multiplicities equals <m>n</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now suppose that the sum of the geometric multiplicities equals <m>n</m>.  As above, this forces the sum of the algebraic multiplicities to equal <m>n</m> as well.  As the algebraic multiplicities are all greater than or equal to the geometric multiplicities in any case, this implies that they are in fact equal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, suppose that the third condition is satisfied.  Then the sum of the geometric multiplicities equals <m>n</m>.  Suppose that the distinct eigenvectors are <m>\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots,\lambda_k</m>, and that <m>\cB_i</m> is a basis for the <m>\lambda_i</m>-eigenspace, which we call <m>V_i</m>.  We claim that the collection <m>\cB = \{v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n\}</m> of all vectors in all of the eigenspace bases <m>\cB_i</m> is linearly independent.  Consider the vector equation
          <me>
            0 = c_1v_1 + c_2v_2 + \cdots + c_nv_n.
          </me>
          Grouping the eigenvectors with the same eigenvalues, this sum has the form
          <me>
            0 = \text{(something in $V_1$)} + \text{(something in $V_2$)} + \cdots + \text{(something in $V_k$)}.
          </me>
          Since <xref ref="evecs-linindep" text="title">eigenvectors with distinct eigenvalues are linearly independent</xref>, each <q>something in <m>V_i</m></q> is equal to zero.  But this implies that all coefficients <m>c_1,c_2,\ldots,c_n</m> are equal to zero, since the vectors in each <m>\cB_i</m> are linearly independent.  Therefore, <m>A</m> has <m>n</m> linearly independent eigenvectors, so it is diagonalizable.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>

    <p>
      The first part of the third statement simply says that the characteristic polynomial of <m>A</m> factors completely into linear polynomials over the real numbers: in other words, there are no complex (non-real) roots.  The second part of the third statement says in particular that for any diagonalizable matrix, the algebraic and geometric multiplicities coincide.

        Let <m>A</m> be a square matrix and let <m>\lambda</m> be an eigenvalue of <m>A</m>.  If the algebraic multiplicity of <m>\lambda</m> does not equal the geometric multiplicity, then <m>A</m> is not diagonalizable.

      The examples at the beginning of this subsection illustrate the theorem.  Here we give some general consequences for diagonalizability of <m>2\times 2</m> and <m>3\times 3</m> matrices.

      <idx><h>Diagonalizability</h><h>of <m>2\times 2</m> matrices</h></idx>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be a <m>2\times 2</m> matrix.  There are four cases:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <m>A</m> has two different eigenvalues.  In this case, each eigenvalue has algebraic and geometric multiplicity equal to one.  This implies <m>A</m> is diagonalizable.  For example:
            <me>A = \mat{1 7; 0 2}.</me>
          </li>
          <li>
            <m>A</m> has one eigenvalue <m>\lambda</m> of algebraic and geometric multiplicity <m>2</m>.  To say that the geometric multiplicity is <m>2</m> means that <m>\Nul(A-\lambda I_2) = \R^2</m>, i.e., that every vector in <m>\R^2</m> is in the null space of <m>A-\lambda I_2</m>.  This implies that <m>A-\lambda I_2</m> is the zero matrix, so that <m>A</m> is the diagonal matrix <m>\lambda I_2</m>.  In particular, <m>A</m> is diagonalizable.  For example:
            <me>A = \mat{1 0; 0 1}.</me>
          </li>
          <li>
            <m>A</m> has one eigenvalue <m>\lambda</m> of algebraic multiplicity <m>2</m> and geometric multiplicity <m>1</m>.  In this case, <m>A</m> is not diagonalizable, by part 3 of the <xref ref="diag-thm-variant"/>.  For example, a <xref ref="diag-eg-shear" text="title">shear</xref>:
            <me>A = \mat{1 1; 0 1}.</me>
          </li>
          <li>
            <m>A</m> has no eigenvalues.  This happens when the characteristic polynomial has no real roots.  In particular, <m>A</m> is not diagonalizable.  For example, a <xref ref="diag-eg-rotation" text="title">rotation</xref>:
            <me>A = \mat{1 -1; 1 1}.</me>
          </li>

      <title>Diagonalizability of <m>3\times 3</m> Matrices</title>
      <idx><h>Diagonalizability</h><h>of <m>3\times 3</m> matrices</h></idx>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be a <m>3\times 3</m> matrix.  We can analyze the diagonalizability of <m>A</m> on a case-by-case basis, as in the previous <xref ref="diag-cases-22"/>.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <m>A</m> has three different eigenvalues.  In this case, each eigenvalue has algebraic and geometric multiplicity equal to one.  This implies <m>A</m> is diagonalizable.  For example:
            <me>A = \mat{1 7 4; 0 2 3; 0 0 -1}.</me>
          </li>
          <li>
            <m>A</m> has two distinct eigenvalues <m>\lambda_1,\lambda_2</m>.  In this case, one has algebraic multiplicity one and the other has algebraic multiplicity two; after reordering, we can assume <m>\lambda_1</m> has multiplicity <m>1</m> and <m>\lambda_2</m> has multiplicity <m>2</m>.  This implies that <m>\lambda_1</m> has geometric multiplicity <m>1</m>, so <em><m>A</m> is diagonalizable if and only if the <m>\lambda_2</m>-eigenspace is a plane.</em>  For example:
            <me>A = \mat{1 7 4; 0 2 0; 0 0 2}.</me>
            On the other hand, if the geometric multiplicity of <m>\lambda_2</m> is <m>1</m>, then <m>A</m> is not diagonalizable.  For example:
            <me>A = \mat{1 7 4; 0 2 1; 0 0 2}.</me>
          </li>
          <li>
            <m>A</m> has only one eigenvalue <m>\lambda</m>.  If the algebraic multiplicity of <m>\lambda</m> is <m>1</m>, then <m>A</m> is not diagonalizable.  This happens when the characteristic polynomial has two complex (non-real) roots.  For example:
            <me>A = \mat{1 -1 0; 1 1 0; 0 0 2}.</me>
            Otherwise, the algebraic multiplicity of <m>\lambda</m> is equal to <m>3</m>.  In this case, if the geometric multiplicity is <m>1</m>:
            <me>A = \mat{1 1 1; 0 1 1; 0 0 1}</me>
            or <m>2</m>:
            <me>A = \mat{1 0 1; 0 1 1; 0 0 1}</me>
            then <m>A</m> is not diagonalizable.  If the geometric multiplicity is <m>3</m>, then <m>\Nul(A-\lambda I_3) = \R^3</m>, so that <m>A-\lambda I_3</m> is the zero matrix, and hence <m>A = \lambda I_3</m>.  Therefore, in this case <m>A</m> is necessarily diagonal, as in:
            <me>A = \mat{1 0 0 ; 0 1 0; 0 0 1}.</me>

    <p>
      Recall from this <xref ref="similarity-charpoly"/> that similar matrices have the same eigenvalues.  It turns out that <em>both</em> notions of multiplicity of an eigenvalue are preserved under similarity.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be similar <m>n\times n</m> matrices, and let <m>\lambda</m> be an eigenvalue of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.  Then:
          <ol>
            <li>
              The algebraic multiplicity of <m>\lambda</m> is the same for <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.
            </li>
            <li>
              The geometric multiplicity of <m>\lambda</m> is the same for <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Since <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> have the same characteristic polynomial, the multiplicity of <m>\lambda</m> as a root of the characteristic polynomial is the same for both matrices, which proves the first statement.  For the second, suppose that <m>A = CBC\inv</m> for an invertible matrix <m>C</m>.  By this <xref ref="similarity-evecs"/>, the matrix <m>C</m> takes eigenvectors of <m>B</m> to eigenvectors of <m>A</m>, both with eigenvalue <m>\lambda</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let <m>\{v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_k\}</m> be a basis of the <m>\lambda</m>-eigenspace of <m>B</m>.  We claim that <m>\{Cv_1,Cv_2,\ldots,Cv_k\}</m> is linearly independent.  Suppose that
          <me>c_1Cv_1 + c_2Cv_2 + \cdots + c_kCv_k = 0.</me>
          Regrouping, this means
          <me>C\bigl(c_1v_1 + c_2v_2 + \cdots + c_kv_k\bigr) = 0.</me>
          By the <xref ref="imt-2"/>, the null space of <m>C</m> is trivial, so this implies
          <me>c_1v_1 + c_2v_2 + \cdots + c_kv_k = 0.</me>
          Since <m>v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_k</m> are linearly independent, we get <m>c_1=c_2=\cdots=c_k=0</m>, as desired.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the previous paragraph, the dimension of the <m>\lambda</m>-eigenspace of <m>A</m> is greater than or equal to the dimension of the <m>\lambda</m>-eigenspace of <m>B</m>.  By symmetry (<m>B</m> is similar to <m>A</m> as well), the dimensions are equal, so the geometric multiplicities coincide.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>

    <p>
      For instance, the four matrices in this <xref ref="diag-cases-22"/> are not similar to each other, because the algebraic and/or geometric multiplicities of the eigenvalues do not match up.  Or, combined with the above <xref ref="diag-thm-variant"/>, we see that a diagonalizable matrix cannot be similar to a non-diagonalizable one, because the algebraic and geometric multiplicities of such matrices cannot both coincide.
    </p>

    <example>
      <p>
        Continuing with this <xref ref="diagonal-eg-33"/>, let
        <me>
          A = \mat{4 -3 0; 2 -1 0; 1 -1 1}.
        </me>
        This is a diagonalizable matrix that is similar to
        <me>
          D = \mat{1 0 0; 0 1 0; 0 0 2}
        \sptxt{using the matrix}
          C = \mat{1 0 3; 1 0 2; 0 1 1}.
        </me>
        The <m>1</m>-eigenspace of <m>D</m> is the <m>xy</m>-plane, and the <m>2</m>-eigenspace is the <m>z</m>-axis.  The matrix <m>C</m> takes the <m>xy</m>-plane to the <m>1</m>-eigenspace of <m>A</m>, which is again a plane, and the <m>z</m>-axis to the <m>2</m>-eigenspace of <m>A</m>, which is again a line.  This shows that the geometric multiplicities of <m>A</m> and <m>D</m> coincide.

      The converse of the <xref ref="diag-similar-amgm"/> is false: there exist matrices  whose eigenvectors have the same algebraic and geometric multiplicities, but which are not similar.  See the <xref ref="diag-eg-nonsimilar"/> below.
      However, for <m>2\times 2</m> and <m>3\times 3</m> matrices whose characteristic polynomial has no complex (non-real) roots, the converse of the <xref ref="diag-similar-amgm"/> is true.  (We will handle the case of complex roots in <xref ref="complex-eigenvalues"/>.)
