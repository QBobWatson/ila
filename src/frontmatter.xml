    <p>
      Rabinoff contributed all of the figures, the demos, and the technical aspects of the project, as detailed below.
      <ul>
        <li>
          The textbook is written in XML and compiled using a variant of Robert Beezer's <url href="https://mathbook.pugetsound.edu/">MathBook XML</url>, with modifications by Rabinoff.
        </li>
        <li>
          The mathematical content of the textbook is written in LaTeX, then converted to HTML-friendly SVG format using a collection of scripts called PreTeX: this was coded by Rabinoff and depends heavily on <url href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</url> for pdf decoding and <url href="https://fontforge.github.io/">FontForge</url> for font embedding.  The figures are written in <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGF/TikZ">PGF/TikZ</url> and processed with PreTeX as well.
        </li>
        <li>
          The demonstrations are written in JavaScript+WebGL using Steven Wittens' brilliant framework called <url href="https://github.com/unconed/mathbox">MathBox</url>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      All source code can be found on <url href="https://github.com/QBobWatson/ila">GitHub</url>.  It may be freely copied, modified, and redistributed, as detailed in the appendix entitled <q>GNU Free Documentation License.</q>

    <title>Editions of this textbook</title>

    <p>
      There are several variants of this textbook available.
      <ul>
        <li>
          You are viewing the Duke Edition of this book.  This edition grew out of the Georgia Tech Edition, but was largely rewritten by Rabinoff for use as in Math 218D-1 at Duke University.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <url href="https://textbooks.math.gatech.edu/ila/">Georgia Tech Edition</url> has material on linear transformations and similar matrices, but does not cover the SVD or PCA.  It was designed for use as the textbook for Math 1553 at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <url href="https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~tbjw/ila/">UBC Edition</url> is similar to the Georgia Tech Edition.
        </li>
      </ul>
